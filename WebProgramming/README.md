#Web Programming

These are projects completed for my Web Programming course at Tufts University.  The course served as an 
introduction in writing web programs, spending half the course on the client-side and the other on server-side
and web security.  Through this course I found a passion for creating appealing web apps through high-quality 
UI and it has inspired me to expand my knowledge for front-end development.
