This project had to be centered around food.  We set out to create a shared
family cookbook, allowing a place for users to submit their tweaks to classic
recipes.  Some of the requirements for the assignment gave us trouble (see the
facebook login button), but we succesfully implemented our goal.  This was my
first venture into Rails, so it was a little overwhelming for me but has given
me a firm understanding of MVC architecture.  I was in charge of the UI and the
recipe pages.
