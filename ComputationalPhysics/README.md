#Computational Physics

This repository contains projects completed in Computational Physics, spring
2015. This was the first time the course was offered, so the difficulty of some
of the projects was overestimated, leaving some of them incomplete. This was
also my first venture into Mathematica, so things started off somewhat rough.
All projects were collaborations, most being groups of 3-4, with a few pair
projects. The first project was the Double Pendulum -- two versions of this are
included. One containing a functional animation with our initial functions and 
the other with the cleaned up functions without animation. I had a lot of fun in
this class as it was right at the crux of my two majors (Computer Science and
Physics).  There was definitely a greater emphasis on Physics, but it was cool
to see how Computer Science is actually being used for real physics projects.
