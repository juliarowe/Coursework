28 April 2015

Implementation:
    Code does not pass HTML validation.  I would need to create a css file in
    order for it to behave the same way, which I did not have time to do.  
    Hopefully I will have time to fix this later.

Collaboration:
    I did not collaborate with anyone on this assignment.

Time Spent:
    I spent approximately 4 hours on this assignment.
